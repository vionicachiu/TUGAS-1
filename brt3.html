			<p class="awal"> Singer-songwriter Jason Mraz released his sixth studio album, &quot;Know.,&quot; on Aug. 10. The album is packed with upbeat tracks and tongue-twisting lyrics and explores the theme of love. The pop album comes four years after his last studio album, &quot;YES!&quot; and in an interview with Billboard, Mraz revealed that much of the album was inspired by love letters he wrote to his wife and also himself &quot;to constantly remind myself that love is still the answer.&quot;</p>
			<p class="berita"> The pop album comes four years after his last studio album, &quot;YES!&quot; and in an interview with Billboard, Mraz revealed that much of the album was inspired by love letters he wrote to his wife and also himself &quot;to constantly remind myself that love is still the answer.&quot;  </p>
			<p class="berita"> Rising to national acclaim after his hit single &quot;The Remedy (I Won&#39;t Worry)&quot; peaked at No. 15 on Billboard&#39;s Top 100 in 2003, Mraz has since garnered a large fan base and performed across the world.  </p>
			<p class="berita"> The ten-track album features pre-released singles &quot;Have It All&quot; and &quot;Unlonely,&quot; the second and fourth songs on the album. &quot;Have It All&quot; is both a benediction and a toast, with the overarching theme of love as the basis of the song.</p>
			<p class="berita"> In an interview with Billboard, Mraz said the first line of the song, &quot;May you have auspiciousness and causes of success,&quot; was originally bestowed upon him by a Buddhist monk in Myanmar. He then continues this scheme by beginning each line of the next two verses with variations of &quot;May you,&quot; combining the corny, the sentimental and the silly to form a feel-good track.</p>
			<p class="berita"> The album begins with &quot;Let&#39;s See What the Night Can Do,&quot; a slow, sweet track that makes the listener feel like they&#39;re gliding along with Mraz&#39;s melodic voice. Featuring a poignant piano line and soft acoustic sounds, the song highlights the romantic in the everyday. </p>
			<p class="berita"> The third song, &quot;More Than Friends,&quot; features pop artist Meghan Trainor and was released on July 27. The soft pop track features soaring harmonies and resonates with listeners who want to take a friendship to the next level.  </p>
			<p class="berita"> &quot;Unlonely,&quot; a love letter disguised under a strong funk beat and rapid-fire lyrics, is next. The catchy song is both clever and memorable, with references to &quot;Happy Days&quot; couple Chachi and Joanie and the food pairing &quot;cheese and macaroni.&quot; </p>
			<p class="berita"> The fifth track, &quot;Better With You,&quot; slowly builds to a driving rhythm via snare drum and cymbal and truly captures the message of the album with the lyrics, &quot;Yeah, life&#39;s about the people who surround you. Love&#39;s the only thing it all comes down to.&quot; </p>
			<p class="berita"> Neither overpowering nor complicated, &quot;No Plans&quot; is a slow, short and sweet song which showcases Mraz&#39;s ability to seamlessly combine his smooth voice with soft acoustic instrumentals </p>
			<p class="berita"> Mraz&#39;s &quot;Sleeping To Dream&quot; was previously released on both his live 2004 album &quot;Tonight Not Again/ Live At the Eagles Ballroom&quot; and his 2007 compilation album &quot;Selections For Friends.&quot; With heart-touching lyrics, this ballad is a testament to his ability to weave metaphors and allusions together to form a cohesive theme. </p>
			<p class="berita"> &quot;Making It Up&quot; is a simple, yet catchy song, with lyrics speaking to the complexity of life and how everyone is just &quot;making it up.&quot; &quot;Might As Well Dance&quot; is a another testament of love to his wife, balanced with humor and a twangy country influence. The music video for the song was released on July 5 and features footage of his wedding ceremony in 2015 to Christina Carano. </p>
			<p class="berita"> The longest song of the album at just over six minutes, &quot;Love Is Still The Answer&quot; is dominated by a moving orchestral instrumental background, featuring the smooth and flowing sounds of violin. The title of the track, which is repeated seven times throughout, underscores the meaning of the album, and the choir joining Mraz toward the end helps create the soaring, melodic and pensive song. </p>
			<p class="berita"> While many of the songs on &quot;Know.&quot; were originally written to Mraz&#39;s wife, the themes behind them are, in a way, a letter to humanity as well. They say to the world, despite everything happening, that &quot;Love is still the answer.&quot; </p>
