			<p class="awal"> Weeks after the inspiring musical movie&#39;s theatrical release, so many fans began adding their own voices to the mix that 20th Century Fox began to schedule special sing-along screenings. That cultural phenomena (along with exposure at this year&#39;s Golden Globes awards) has helped to propel the soundtrack to the pinnacle of Billboard&#39;s album chart. In fact, it&#39;s the first movie soundtrack to hold the top spot for two weeks in a row since the one for Suicide Squad accomplished that feat in the summer of 2016, according to The New York Times. Though the movie&#39;s storyline is fraught with some historical innacuracies, the songs themselves celebrate messages of empowerment and personal dignity that have the ability to span centuries.</p>
			<p class="berita"> The Greatest Showman majors in the message that tenacity, hard work and optimism enable us to achieve our wildest dreams. Those themes are evident in album opener &quot;The Greastest Show,&quot; where we hear, &quot;Impossible comes true, it&#39;s taking over you/Oh, this is the greatest show.&quot; P.T. Barnum (played by actor and singer Hugh Jackman) insists that the circus can be a home for society&#39;s misfits, a place &quot;where the lost get found in the crown of the circus king.&quot; Elsewhere, the song says of such belonging, &quot;It&#39;s fire, it&#39;s freedom, it&#39;s flooding open,&quot; and even makes this spiriutal comparison: &quot;It&#39;s a preacher in the pulpit and you&#39;ll find devotion&quot; (though that comparision could also be heard as a negative one as well). </p>
			<p class="berita"> In &quot;A Million Dreams&quot; P.T. Barnum and his wife, Charity (played by actor/singer Michelle Williams), encourage themselves and others, to &quot;live in a world that we design&quot; while shrugging off the negative comments of those who may &quot;call us crazy.&quot; The song recognizes the power of passion-fueled dreams, telling us that &quot;a million dreams is all it&#39;s gonna take&quot; to make the world we desire. This song is also a promise to Barnum&#39;s family about the world he hopes and intends to create for them. </p>
			<p class="berita"> &quot;Come Alive&quot; has Barnum and his family urging others to &quot;shake awake&quot; and &quot;brighten up your darkest day&quot; by stepping out of the &quot;shadows&quot; and dreaming &quot;with your eyes wide open.&quot; This song encourages others to recognize the potential they have in this life. </p>
			<p class="berita"> Renowned opera star Jenny Lind (played by Rebecca Ferguson with singing overdubs by The Voice contestant Loren Allred) sings that without the one you love by your side, &quot;all the shine of a thousand spotlights&quot; and even &quot;towers of gold&quot; will &quot;never be enough&quot; to satisfy. In &quot;From Now On&quot; Barnum declares that he will never again be &quot;blinded by the light&quot; of fortune that caused him to live at a &quot;crazy speed of always needing more,&quot; and to neglect his family for a time.</p>
			<p class="berita"> Barnum wants to convince a young man named Phillip (played and voiced by Zac Efron) to become his business partner, telling him that if &quot;you run with me/I can cut you free/Out of the treachery and walls you keep in.&quot; Barnum also promises the younger man that while his style may be &quot;a little crazy,&quot; it will provide Phillip with the &quot;freedom to dream.&quot; </p>
			<p class="berita"> The anthem &quot;This Is Me&quot; showcases the beauty of individuality and the courage necessary to persevere &quot;when the sharpest words wanna cut me down.&quot; The song insists that even when people feel like they&#39;re outcasts, when they feel broken &quot;down to dust&quot; that they are actually &quot;glorious.&quot; </p>
			<p class="berita"> In &quot;Rewrite the Stars,&quot; an interracial couple defies cultural norms of the time to pursue a relationship, declaring that &quot;no one can say what we get to be.&quot; And in &quot;Tightrope,&quot; Charity sings that she will follow Barnum &quot;to the great unknown&#47;... Hand in hand&quot; and &quot;never let go,&quot; no matter &quot;how far we could fall.&quot; She shows true devotion to a man she loves, even while he temporarily loses himself in fame. </p>
			<p class="berita"> In &quot;Come Alive&quot; Barnum describes people who are &quot;like a zombie in a maze&quot; because they can&#39;t seem to recognize that they&#39;ve perpetually settled for less. </p>
			<p class="berita"> At the conclusion of The Greatest Showman, P.T. Barnum sits with his wife, watching their daughter pursue her dream to become a ballerina, and you&#39;re left with this feeling that peace and goodness have been restored. He&#39;s made mistakes in the pursuit of his own dreams; but he seems deeply determined to be present with his family as his daughters pursue theirs. </p>
			<p class="berita"> The accompanying soundtrack follows a similar arc, from inspiration, to passion, to regret, to resolution. We&#39;re treated to songs that repeatedly emphasize the positive, redemptive themes of perseverance, determination, courage, and&ndash;ultimately&ndash;humility. We&#39;re encouraged to stand tall and strong, whether that&#39;s with others or, sometimes, on our own. All in all, it&#39;s a passionate musical journey with much to recommend it&ndash;as long as you&#39;re mindful of a couple of navigable bumps along the way. </p>
