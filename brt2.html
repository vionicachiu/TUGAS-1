			<hr>

			<p class="awal"> After a yearlong hiatus, Ed Sheeran has released his third album &quot;&#247;&quot; &ndash; read as &quot;divide.&quot; Despite creating distinct eras through the math symbol stylization pattern, &quot;Divide&quot; does not significantly vary from the &quot;Multiply&quot; (&quot;x&quot;) or &quot;Plus&quot; (&quot;+&quot;) era. &quot;Divide&quot; flickers back and forth between Sheeran&#39;s heart-felt ballads and distinctive acoustic, hip hop songs. A notable difference is the incorporation of folk-inspired sounds.</p>
			<p class="berita"> The two singles from the album, &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot; and &quot;Shape of You,&quot; were released on the same day, and hint at the two music flavors for which Sheeran is known. &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot; is an upbeat pop ballad. One of Sheeran&#39;s strengths lies in his sincerity and storytelling skills, which are prevalent in this track. &quot;One's brother overdosed, one's already on his second wife, one's just barely getting by,&quot; sang Sheeran </p>
			<p class="berita"> In contrast, &quot;Shape of You&quot; has been filling the radio airwaves with its bouncing electronic beat. This track stands out on the album as Sheeran&#39;s experiment with synth sounds. </p>
			<p class="berita"> &quot;Galway Girl&quot; is a fun play between Sheeran&#39;s hip-hop and ballad styles as he flips between the two. This track is also the first of several to incorporate folk elements. The fiddle is recognizable in the chorus which references the instrument directly in the line, &quot;She played the fiddle in an Irish band.&quot; </p>
			<p class="berita"> Toward the end of the track, the backing vocals build in a chanting style adding to the ambience of a folk dance party to the song. The folk sound appears again in the track &quot;Nancy Mulligan.&quot;</p>
			<p class="berita"> The standard edition of the album ends with the heart-wrenching ballad &quot;Supermarket Flowers&quot; which is dedicated to Sheeran&#39;s grandmother. The song is stripped back to a piano and Sheeran&#39;s vocals. He sang, &quot;A heart that&#39;s broke is a heart that&#39;s been loved.&quot; The simple instrumentation carries throughout and brings with it a soul-bearing quality. The subtle addition of backing vocals in the chorus as Sheeran sang, &quot;So I&#39;ll sing Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum,&quot; fills out the song. The angelic, gospel choir backing vocals further the song&#39;s mournful but heartfelt sound. </p>
			<p class="berita"> The extended edition of the album adds several upbeat, feel good tracks to the end of &quot;Divide.&quot; For instance, &quot;Barcelona&quot; incorporates fresh instruments like the saxophone and trumpet, which give it a fun, breezy quality. Continuing the international trend of Barcelona and Ireland (&quot;Galway Girl&quot;), the playful &quot;Bibia Be Ye Ye&quot; features lyrics in Twi, a language spoken in Ghana. The title means &quot;All Will Be Well&quot; and the quick beat and bright guitar highlight this reassuring lightheartedness. </p>
			<p class="berita"> &quot;Divide&quot; feels like a natural progression from Sheeran&#39;s previous works. Although the flow of the tracks is somewhat abrupt, many of the individual tracks work alone. Mirroring melodies like in the chorus of &quot;Happier&quot; and &quot;Bibia Be Ye Ye&quot; try to tie the tracks together, but are not particularly effective. The brashness of songs like &quot;New Man&quot; is subdued and balanced by those more heartfelt such as &quot;Supermarket Flowers.&quot; The folk inspiration adds a new dynamic quality to Sheeran&#39;s repertoire. </p>
