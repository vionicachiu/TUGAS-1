			<p class="awal"> Singer-songwriter Jason Mraz released his sixth studio album, &quot;Know.,&quot; on Aug. 10. The album is packed with upbeat tracks and tongue-twisting lyrics and explores the theme of love. The pop album comes four years after his last studio album, &quot;YES!&quot; and in an interview with Billboard, Mraz revealed that much of the album was inspired by love letters he wrote to his wife and also himself &quot;to constantly remind myself that love is still the answer.&quot; </p>

			<p class="awal"> After a yearlong hiatus, Ed Sheeran has released his third album &quot;&#247;&quot; &ndash; read as &quot;divide.&quot; Despite creating distinct eras through the math symbol stylization pattern, &quot;Divide&quot; does not significantly vary from the &quot;Multiply&quot; (&quot;x&quot;) or &quot;Plus&quot; (&quot;+&quot;) era. &quot;Divide&quot; flickers back and forth between Sheeran&#39;s heart-felt ballads and distinctive acoustic, hip hop songs. A notable difference is the incorporation of folk-inspired sounds.</p>

			<p class="awal"> Weeks after the inspiring musical movie&#39;s theatrical release, so many fans began adding their own voices to the mix that 20th Century Fox began to schedule special sing-along screenings. That cultural phenomena (along with exposure at this year&#39;s Golden Globes awards) has helped to propel the soundtrack to the pinnacle of Billboard&#39;s album chart. In fact, it&#39;s the first movie soundtrack to hold the top spot for two weeks in a row since the one for Suicide Squad accomplished that feat in the summer of 2016, according to The New York Times. Though the movie&#39;s storyline is fraught with some historical innacuracies, the songs themselves celebrate messages of empowerment and personal dignity that have the ability to span centuries.</p>
