			<p class="awal"> Singer-songwriter Jason Mraz released his sixth studio album, &quot;Know.,&quot; on Aug. 10. The album is packed with upbeat tracks and tongue-twisting lyrics and explores the theme of love. The pop album comes four years after his last studio album, &quot;YES!&quot; and in an interview with Billboard, Mraz revealed that much of the album was inspired by love letters he wrote to his wife and also himself &quot;to constantly remind myself that love is still the answer.&quot; </p>

			<p class="awal"> After a yearlong hiatus, Ed Sheeran has released his third album &quot;&#247;&quot; &ndash; read as &quot;divide.&quot; Despite creating distinct eras through the math symbol stylization pattern, &quot;Divide&quot; does not significantly vary from the &quot;Multiply&quot; (&quot;x&quot;) or &quot;Plus&quot; (&quot;+&quot;) era. &quot;Divide&quot;flickers back and forth between Sheeran&#39;s heart-felt ballads and distinctive acoustic, hip hop songs. A notable difference is the incorporation of folk-inspired sounds.</p>

			<hr>

			<p class="awal"> No pop historian in the business right now is as successful at reinventing top 40's past as Bruno Mars.  Since his emergence, the singer-songwriter has displayed the ability to capture the essence of what made so many of the greats' music timeless, making him one of the most consistently popular artists of his era. That trend should only continue with Bruno Mars' latest album, 24K Magic, released Friday (Nov. 18), which pays homage to any number of pop performers from his canon, in winking tributes that still keep one foot (or at least a couple of toes) in the present. Here's a track-by-track guide to 24K Magic. Once you've fallen under its spell, check out some of the older songs that likely helped influence Mars' latest gem.</p>
